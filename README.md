Citizen analysis of the climate change raw station temperature data from - CRUTEM.4.6.0.0.station_files.


### Citizen analysis of climate change temperature data.

I pulled random stations from the climate change live data : https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/crutem4/data/download.html.  

Downloaded the station data : CRUTEM.4.6.0.0.station_files.zip has been included under there own license for study.

I extracted the text files for each station, opened them with Kate (Kubuntu text editor), copied the text then, paste inserted them into a LibreOffice spreadsheet. I deleted the months with 99 Degrees Centigrade, then updated the charts.

Having plotted the climate data for a number of stations, I found that most temperature charts were flat over a 5 year average, but some particularly in Russia had increased up to 3 or 4 degrees.

I noted that the data has already been averaged into one monthly average, i.e. has already been processed. 
I noted that a lot more stations have to be done if the climate change is 1 degree within a natural variation of 3 Degrees ....


I am requesting volunteers to complete a significant random sample of data, then produce some combination analysis to confirm or deny any global effect, from this data. Request raw data and complete similar analysis to check monthly data is correct by recalculating samples.
